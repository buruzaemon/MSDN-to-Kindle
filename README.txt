This is my version of the Package This util.

The original was a tad prone to throwing exceptions :) 
So, as well as cleaning that up, I plan to stick a WPF front end on this and have it output .mobi files for
use on a Kindle. (think using a kindle to revise MSDN content for the MCTS exams)

So far the solution structure has been cleaned up and it now uses WCF (a bit!)
